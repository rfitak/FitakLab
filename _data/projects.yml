- name: Magnetoreception in Animals
  description: >
    Over the last several decades, behavior experiments have shown that a
    variety of animals are capable of sensing Earth's magnetic field.  Although
    several theories exist to explain this phenomenon, the underlying molecular
    basis remains unknown.  Oue research at UCF is trying to identify the
    possible location of a 'magnetoreceptor' and putative genes involved in a
    magnetic sense.  We utilize various RNA-seq experiments in fish
    (i.e. salmonids) to quantify changes in gene expression after exposure
    to magnetic stimuli.  We have examined both the brain and retina to date.
    There is essentially no change in gene expression in the retina, but
    numerous changes were observed in the brain.  The changes in the brain
    have yielded 'candidate magnetoreception genes', such as the protein
    ferritin, in which ongoing experiments are examining more closely.

- name: Geomagnetic Biogeography
  description: >
    Earth’s magnetic field is quite dynamic  - varying in strength, orientation,
    and even occasionally reversing polarity (swapping the North and South poles).
    It is possible this variation disrupts the navigation of species that depend on
    Earth’s magnetic field to migrate.  Currently, we are outlining a conceptual
    approach for how population genetics can reveal changes in the demographic
    history and/or biogeography of species as a result of this variation - a
    phenomenon we call 'geomagnetic biogeography'. 
    <br>
    We have provided some preliminary evidence in green sea turtles, where we recently
    showed that changes in gene flow between populations can account, at least partially,
    for a sudden increase in historical effective population size around the time of the
    last polarity reversal (780,000 years ago).  This result, along with some great work by
    others, suggest that geomagnetic variation may have important consequences on the migration,
    and in turn, biogeography, of species that navigate using the geomagnetic field.  Our goal
    is to continue work in this area in other 'magnetically sensitive' or navigating species to
    determine the role geomagnetic history plays in shaping species’ demography.

    <b>The American shad (<i>Alosa sapidissima</i>) genome: understanding the
    evolutionary novelties of the “fish that fed the Nation’s founders"</b>
    <br>
    American shad are anadromous fish distributed throughout the North American
    Atlantic coast, and prior to the 20th century, were one of the most economically
    important fisheries in the U.S. Adults spend most of their life at sea, and return
    in the spring to their natal streams to spawn.  This migratory behavior, like that
    of salmonids, is of particular interest to sensory biologists as the exact environmental
    cues employed to navigate to their natal areas remains unclear.  It has been demonstrated
    in salmonids that the geomagnetic field can be used to navigate, but whether or not
    shad utilize the same method is unknown.  American shad also have evolved several other
    unique features of interest to sensory biologists.  First, unlike most fish, shad lack a
    distinct lateral line (a critical electrophysiological and mechanosensory ‘organ’).  Second,
    shad can hear ultrasonic sounds up to 180 kHz (compared with 20 kHz in humans), one of the
    highest frequency ranges of any organism ever recorded and speculated to be a defense against
    cetacean echolocation (~40 – 150 kHz).  Despite the unique sensory features of American shad,
    little research has focused on this species.  One reason is the lack of genetic and genomic
    resources available. Not only will genomic resources facilitate evolutionary and functional studies
    of these unique sensory capabilities, but provide additional genetic resources to the wild
    fisheries managers to benefit the conservation and management of this important local resource.
    Currently, through a grant from Duke's Center for Genomics and Computational Biology, we are
    sequencing and assembling the first American shad genome.
