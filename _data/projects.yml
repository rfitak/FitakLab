- name: Magnetoreception in Animals
  description: >
    Over the last several decades, behavior experiments have shown that a
    variety of animals are capable of sensing Earth's magnetic field.  Although
    several theories exist to explain this phenomenon, the underlying molecular
    basis remains unknown.  Oue research at UCF is trying to identify the
    possible location of a 'magnetoreceptor' and putative genes involved in a
    magnetic sense.  We utilize various RNA-seq experiments in fish
    (i.e. salmonids) to quantify changes in gene expression after exposure
    to magnetic stimuli.  We have examined both the brain and retina to date.
    There is essentially no change in gene expression in the retina, but
    numerous changes were observed in the brain.  The changes in the brain
    have yielded 'candidate magnetoreception genes', such as the protein
    ferritin, in which ongoing experiments are examining more closely.

- name: Geomagnetic Biogeography
  description: >
    Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma is a genetically heterogeneous form of cancer, 
    with different cells in the tumour acquiring different mutations. This 
    intra-tumour heterogeneity can have profound effects on treatment; if a clonal 
    subpopulations is resistant to treatment, it will reform the tumour following 
    treatment, causing the patient to relapse. We are recieving samples from several
    clinical trials exploring different salvage therapies for patients with relapsed
    DLBCL. Tumour biopsies and liquid biopsies are being collected from patients 
    both before and after they are treated. Using these temporal sources of tumour DNA,
    we can identify clonal subpopulations in the tumour, 
    and further explore how the tumour evolves and adapts in the face of a strong 
    selective pressure such as treatment. The mutations unique to these resistant 
    clonal subpopulations can be explored to determine which mutation(s) result 
    in treatment resistance. We can further determine if these mutations are 
    detectable prior to treatment, which may allow patient to be screened for resistance 
    mutations before they are treated.

    American shad are anadromous fish distributed throughout the North American
    Atlantic coast, and prior to the 20th century, were one of the most economically
    important fisheries in the U.S. Adults spend most of their life at sea, and return
    in the spring to their natal streams to spawn.  This migratory behavior, like that
    of salmonids, is of particular interest to sensory biologists as the exact environmental
    cues employed to navigate to their natal areas remains unclear.  It has been demonstrated
    in salmonids that the geomagnetic field can be used to navigate, but whether or not
    shad utilize the same method is unknown.  American shad also have evolved several other
    unique features of interest to sensory biologists.  First, unlike most fish, shad lack a
    distinct lateral line (a critical electrophysiological and mechanosensory ‘organ’).  Second,
    shad can hear ultrasonic sounds up to 180 kHz (compared with 20 kHz in humans), one of the
    highest frequency ranges of any organism ever recorded and speculated to be a defense against
    cetacean echolocation (~40 – 150 kHz).  Despite the unique sensory features of American shad,
    little research has focused on this species.  One reason is the lack of genetic and genomic
    resources available. Not only will genomic resources facilitate evolutionary and functional studies
    of these unique sensory capabilities, but provide additional genetic resources to the wild
    fisheries managers to benefit the conservation and management of this important local resource.
    Currently, through a grant from Duke's Center for Genomics and Computational Biology, we are
    sequencing and assembling the first American shad genome.
