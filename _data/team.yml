  bio: >
    I am an Assistant Professor in the
    <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/">Department of Biology</a> at the
    <a href="http://www.ucf.edu">University of Central Florida</a> and also hold an
    appointment as a core member of the
    <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/faculty/cluster/genomics-bioinformatics/">Genomics and Bioinformatics Cluster</a>.
    I completed my BS in molecular genetics at The Ohio State University and PhD
    in the Genetics Interdisciplinary Program at the University of Arizona in the laboratory
    of Dr. Melanie Culver.  My early research involved the development of SNP markers to monitor puma
    populations in the southwestern USA and a conservation genomic analysis of the
    endangered Mexican wolf (<i>Canis lupus baileyi</i>).  I have also performed a
    variety of conservation genetic and genomic projects in many other protected species
    including <i>Anodontid</i> mussels, Mt. Graham red squirrels, Old World camels, Florida
    panthers, etc.  Recently, I have focused on applying genomic techniques to studies of
    unique sensory physiology, such as magnetoreception and dermal photoreception. I also
    am very interested in studying wildlife diseases, such as the emerging "Snake Fungus"
    (Ophidiomyces) pathogen, and teach bioinformatics at the <a href="https://gdwworkshop.colostate.edu">Genomics of Disease in Wildlife</a>
    Workshop every June at Colorado State University. In my spare time, I do a lot of
    running, hiking, herping, furniture making, in addition to playing lots of soccer.

    Alex obtained his B.S. from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he studied the genetic effects of recent habitat fragmentation on the endangered Perote ground squirrel (<i>Xerospermophilus perotensis</i>). He then obtained a PhD in Natural Resources (with emphasis in Wildlife Management and Conservation) from the University of Arizona, where he focused on topics related to population genomics/genetics of endangered wildlife, particularly of Florida panthers (<i>Puma concolor coryi</i>), jaguars (<i>Panthera onca</i>), and Arabian oryx (<i>Oryx leucoryx</i>). After completing his PhD, Alex concluded a three-year postdoctoral appointment at the Ohio State University, where he studied genomics and venom gene evolution of the threatened Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake (<i>Sistrurus catenatus</i>). As a postdoctoral scholar in the Fitak Lab, Alex will continue research with population genomics questions associated with wildlife management and conservation. In his spare time, Alex enjoys watching movies, camping, and playing soccer.

    An avid tide pooler and scuba diver from Seattle, Taryn grew up
    fascinated by the behavior of marine animals. She is particularly
    fond of the remarkably intelligent giant Pacific octopus. Taryn
    decided to attend graduate school to investigate the molecular
    basis of cognition in octopuses and other cephalopods. Her
    research interests stem from a lifelong curiosity about animal
    behavior and a passion for comparative neuroscience.

    Taryn graduated from Western Washington University with a B.S.
    in Behavioral Neuroscience. In the Rose Learning and Memory Lab,
    Taryn studied associative learning and oxidative stress in the
    model <i>C. elegans</i>. Following graduate school, she plans to
    pursue post-doctoral training and to eventually become a faculty
    researcher in comparative neurobiology. In the meantime, Taryn may
    be found exploring Florida’s scuba diving sites during her study
    breaks.

    George earned his B.S. from the University of California - Davis,
    where he worked as a technician in several labs studying
    topics including the ovipositor morphology of invasive
    spotted wing Drosophila (<i>Drosophia suzukii</i>), tritrophic
    interactions in plant defense systems of sticky tarweed
    (<i>Madia elegans</i>), and habitat use by western pond
    turtles (<i>Actinemys marmorata</i>), also assisting with
    capture surveys of California invasive northern water snakes
    (<i>Nerodia sipedon</i>). After graduating from UC Davis,
    George worked in Bayer’s biological agricultural research and
    development group for 5 years as a member of their entomology
    team, working closely with scientists from several fields including
    data science and bioinformatics.<br>
    George returned to school to develop as a conservation scientist. He
    is broadly interested in studying how changing environments
    affect organisms at a genomic level and how this may influence
    phenotypic and behavioral traits and biodiversity.

    Coral was a Biology undergraduate with a minor in chemistry. 
    Her interests are in wildlife disease and medicine, specifically in
    relation to species native to Florida. Her current research involves 
    investigating infectious diseases affecting burrowing owl populations 
    through the de novo discovery of pathogens from existing genomic data. 
    Her goal is to use this information to help develop improved
    conservation management of the burrowing owl populations. When she 
    has time, she paints animals and scenery using watercolors.

    UCF. She transferred from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto 
    Rico-Ponce Campus (PUCPR) in Spring 2018 after being displaced by 
    Hurricane María. As an undergraduate at PUCPR, Arimar worked as a General 
    Chemistry I peer mentor, and as a clerical assistant in the Encarnación-Valdés 
    Library. She also interned at a private veterinary clinic in Ponce. Since 
    Spring 2018, Arimar has been volunteering as an usher at the Iglesia Victoria 
    en La Cruz, where she congregates regularly. She joined the Fitak Lab and 
    the Honors Undergraduate Thesis Program at UCF in the Spring 2020 semester. 
    Currently, her research project aims to characterize the visual system of lone
    star ticks using transcriptomics. In other words, do male lone star ticks
    have the machinery to see the characteristic yellow spot on females? After 
    graduating from UCF, Arimar wants to pursue a Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine 
    and eventually specialize in canine/feline practice.<br> You can learn more
