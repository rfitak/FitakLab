    I am an Assistant Professor in the
    <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/">Department of Biology</a> at the
    <a href="http://www.ucf.edu">University of Central Florida</a> and also hold an
    appointment as a core member of the
    <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/faculty/cluster/genomics-bioinformatics/">Genomics and Bioinformatics Cluster</a>.
    I completed my BS in molecular genetics at The Ohio State University and PhD
    in the Genetics Interdisciplinary Program at the University of Arizona in the laboratory
    of Dr. Melanie Culver.  My early research involved the development of SNP markers to monitor puma
    populations in the southwestern USA and a conservation genomic analysis of the
    endangered Mexican wolf (<i>Canis lupus baileyi</i>).  I have also performed a
    variety of conservation genetic and genomic projects in many other protected species
    including <i>Anodontid</i> mussels, Mt. Graham red squirrels, Old World camels, Florida
    panthers, etc.  Recently, I have focused on applying genomic techniques to studies of
    unique sensory physiology, such as magnetoreception and dermal photoreception. I also
    am very interested in studying wildlife diseases, such as the emerging "Snake Fungus"
    (Ophidiomyces) pathogen, and teach bioinformatics at the <a href="https://gdwworkshop.colostate.edu">Genomics of Disease in Wildlife</a>
    Workshop every June at Colorado State University. In my spare time, I do a lot of
    running, hiking, herping, furniture making, in addition to playing lots of soccer.

    Anna is a native Floridan who spent a large portion of her time outdoors growing up – something that has not changed. In her free time, she loves being in nature, whatever the format. Her love of and fascination with the flora and fauna of wild Florida inspired her to study Evolutionary Ecology and Conservation at UCF. She is a Land Management Intern at UCF’s Arboretum, the 850-acre natural lands owned and actively managed by the university. Surrounded by urban activity and connected to the Florida Wildlife Corridor (a statewide project that aims to ensure protected lands stay connected), this on-campus urban forest offers unique opportunities to study wildlife at an urban-wildland interface. Through camera trapping, she has led wildlife monitoring projects in the Arboretum. While an effective tool for communication and relative diversity assessments, wildlife camera traps have limitations in the amount of information they provide. For a more in depth understanding of carnivore populations in the Arboretum, she is conducting genetic analysis of fecal DNA samples and researching ways that information could be used for ecological evaluations such as occupancy, diet, and habitat use. Like camera trapping, this noninvasive survey method helps to tell the story of wildlife living in the in the complex landscape of an urban forest. Her goal is to help uncover and tell that story for applications in conservation, education, and wildlife management at UCF.
