  bio: >
    I am an Assistant Professor in the
    <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/">Department of Biology</a> at the
    <a href="http://www.ucf.edu">University of Central Florida</a> and also hold an
    appointment as a core member of the
    <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/faculty/cluster/genomics-bioinformatics/">Genomics and Bioinformatics Cluster</a>.
    I completed my BS in molecular genetics at The Ohio State University and PhD
    in the Genetics Interdisciplinary Program at the University of Arizona in the laboratory
    of Dr. Melanie Culver.  My early research involved the development of SNP markers to monitor puma
    populations in the southwestern USA and a conservation genomic analysis of the
    endangered Mexican wolf (<i>Canis lupus baileyi</i>).  I have also performed a
    variety of conservation genetic and genomic projects in many other protected species
    including <i>Anodontid</i> mussels, Mt. Graham red squirrels, Old World camels, Florida
    panthers, etc.  Recently, I have focused on applying genomic techniques to studies of
    unique sensory physiology, such as magnetoreception and dermal photoreception. I also
    am very interested in studying wildlife diseases, such as the emerging "Snake Fungus"
    (Ophidiomyces) pathogen, and teach bioinformatics at the <a href="https://gdwworkshop.colostate.edu">Genomics of Disease in Wildlife</a>
    Workshop every June at Colorado State University. In my spare time, I do a lot of
    running, hiking, herping, furniture making, in addition to playing lots of soccer.

    My main role at the Morin lab focuses on the development and 
    implementation of assays with potential utility in the genetic 
    stratification, non-invasive monitoring and management of cancer 
    patients. 
    We have developed assays relying on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874686">targeted hybridization capture 
    followed by high throughput sequencing</a> as well as assays relying on 
    droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). 
    I am particularly interested in the development and optimization of 
    molecular techinques for the ultrasensitive and straightforward 
    detection of tumour-derived DNA fragments. 
    Detection and quantification of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) via 
    duplex sequencing with semi-degenerate barcoded adapters and the use 
    of wild-type specific hydrolysis probes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27440511">(“inverted” ddPCR)</a> to detect 
    multiple recurrent somatic mutations of clinical relevance are 
    amongst my main contributions into this growing area of research.
    Currently, I am involved in different projects related to the genetic 
    characterization of different types of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and the 
    detection, quantification and serial monitoring of ctDNA in cancer 
    patients, including those enrolled in the personalized oncogenomics 
    project (POG). We are also starting to apply our error-correction 
    duplex sequencing approach for the sequencing of ancient DNA, 
    including archaeological specimens of both pacific salmons and 
    woolly dogs.
