    I am a core instructor at the Genomics of Disease in Wildlife workshop, held annually in June at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO, USA.  I teach an introduction to the command line, along with various aspects of bioinformatics, genomics, and next-generation sequencing analysis.  This is a terrific group of instructors and organizers, and I encourage anyone interested in learning about genomics, especially from the perspective of investigating wildlife diseases, to apply.
