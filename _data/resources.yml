    I am a core instructor at the Genomics of Disease in Wildlife workshop, held annually in June at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO, USA.  I teach an introduction to the command line, along with various aspects of bioinformatics, genomics, and next-generation sequencing analysis.  This is a terrific group of instructors and organizers, and I encourage anyone interested in learning about genomics, especially from the perspective of investigating wildlife diseases, to apply.

    I really find this page from the Tye Lab at the Salk Institute to be an accurate description of graduate school philosophy, goals, and expectations.  I encourage those interested in joining the lab to review this webpage.

    I have not participated in this course, but I know many graduate students that have, as well as instructors, and it comes highly recommended. The course is offered every few years, and often produces great publications (see list <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/landscapegeneticscourse/home/group-project-publications">here</a>)  Here is a description of the course:<br><p style="font-size:12px">The Landscape Genetics Distributed Graduate Seminar (DGS) is an international collaboration that provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary graduate training. The course draws on experts from around the world to deliver an in-depth introduction and overview of the field of landscape genetics. The course caters to students in both basic and applied ecology, conservation/population genetics, landscape ecology and conservation biology. Every other year, several hundred students, post-docs and faculty from around the world participate in this course.</p>

    Check out Sönke Johnsen's lab webpage at Duke University where I spent more than four years as a postdoctoral researcher. If you are intested in visual ecology at all, especially of marine and deep-sea organisms, get in touch with Sönke!
